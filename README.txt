This is a single page HTML app that allows the user to add/edit employees, those employees can submit events, and those events can be exported and imported via xml files generated by the buttons.

How to use:

1. You will need a link to view the EventLogger.html file. Get it from someone who uses it.

2. Download the EventLogger.html file. It should work on any device that uses a browser with javascript.

3. Open EventLogger.html

4. Click on the Employee Manager link to add your employee information. Choose a color - this will be the color that makes your events stand out in the table from the other employees if necessary.

5. Click on Event Logger. Now you can select your name from the dropdown to being adding events.

6. Either manually set the date and time of your event, or click the button that says "Current Time" to use the current date and time.

7. Describe the event in the Event Text field.

8. Click "Add Event" to add your event to the log. You can edit or delete the event from the buttons in the action column.

9. To export your events, click the "Export Events to XML" button underneath the Events table. You can send this file via email to whomever requires your logged events.

10. To import events from another employee's log, click on the "Import XML" button, then select the xml document from the employee you requests events from. This will poulate the Imported Events table with those events.

Important Note: This application currently uses localStorage, meaning the information it stores is unique to the device using it, and it doesn't require an internet connection for any of its functionality. Events can only be shared by exporting to xml, transferring the file to another device, and importing those events via the Import XML button.

In this future, this application may be upgraded to a full-stack model, which will utilize an online database to share events over the internet - but that is a long way off. For now, enjoy the offline functionality of a simple text-based event logger for any device, and share the download link with any employee you wish to share with.
